Dog first aid
Knowing dog first aid is essential for every dog owner, trainer, or fosterer. While you should always consult your vet with any health concerns or after an accident, having a basic understanding of first aid can make a crucial difference in an emergency by providing comfort and support to your dog until they can get proper medical attention.

What should be included in your dog's first aid kit? 
A well-prepared dog first aid kit can make a huge difference in emergencies or when treating minor injuries. Some essential items to include are: 

Sterile gauze pads for wound dressing 
Disposable gloves
Adhesive tape to secure gauze
A clean towel
Curved scissors and tweezers for safe handling 
Tick removal tool for correctly removing ticks 
Cold pack for reducing swelling and pain 
Saline solution for eye injuries and rinsing wounds 
Emergency contact information for your vet and local emergency vet 
Muzzle in case your dog bites out of pain or fear 
Any medication specific to your dog’s needs as prescribed by your dog’s vet
You should never give your dog medication meant for humans, as common drugs like ibuprofen and naproxen are highly dangerous for dogs. Always speak to your vet rather than administering medication yourself.


Recognising when your dog is unwell or injured
Understanding what’s normal behaviour for your dog means you’ll recognise any changes in behaviour or body language that might indicate they’re unwell or in pain. Dogs have individual personalities. Being familiar with their usual habits and behaviour helps you spot changes that might signal something isn't right. If you notice any significant changes in your dog's usual behaviour, you should act promptly and contact your vet. Catching any health problems early can make a real difference to their wellbeing and recovery.


Detecting unusual signs or changes in body language
Dogs may not be able to communicate verbally, but they express themselves through body language and behaviour. Knowing your dog well allows you to recognise unusual signs of illness or pain, such as excessive panting, trembling, hiding, the position of their ears or tail or even a reluctance to move or play. If your dog is usually energetic but suddenly becomes lethargic and withdrawn, it may be a sign that they’re unwell. Similarly, a typically friendly dog might become withdrawn, or even show signs of anxiety or aggression, due to injury or pain.

Noticing changes in eating habits
Changes in appetite or eating habits can be a good indicator of how your dog is feeling. If your dog suddenly stops eating or is disinterested in food, it could be a sign of an underlying health issue.

Recognising grooming patterns
Dogs are generally good at cleaning themselves. A change in their grooming behaviour, a decline in their general cleanliness upkeep, or excessive licking, especially when it is targeted to a specific place on the body, may suggest illness or an injury.


Monitoring toileting habits
Knowing your dog's regular toileting habits can help you notice anything unusual. Going more or less frequently, straining, diarrhoea or blood in the urine or stool are all signs that something might be wrong.

Common illnesses or injuries
Being aware of any changes in your dog's health is a crucial part of responsible dog ownership. Dogs, like us, can face a range of common health issues that might affect their wellbeing. By recognising the signs and symptoms of these illnesses or injuries, you can make sure your dog keeps fit and well and gets the correct care and attention should something be amiss.


Insect stings and bites
You might not always be aware of your dog getting stung or bitten by an insect, but if you notice your dog is excessively scratching or has hives or a rash, it may be a sign that they have been bitten.

Try to locate the bite or sting on their body. If possible, remove the stinger by brushing it out, if this is unsuccessful, try carefully using tweezers. Clean the area gently with cooled boiled water, and monitor the area closely for signs of infection. Apply a cold pack wrapped in a towel to the affected area to reduce swelling and soothe discomfort. Monitor your dog for any signs of allergic reactions, such as excessive swelling or difficulty breathing, and if you notice any of these symptoms, contact your vet immediately.


Wounds and bleeding
If your dog has a deep cut or is bleeding heavily, apply pressure to the wound using clean materials like towels or gauze pads and immediately take them to the vet. Avoid removing the pressure; even if blood seeps through, don't remove the material; just add more layers of cloth to maintain pressure.

You can treat your dog at home for minor cuts as long as the layer below the skin isn't exposed. If you're unsure, always seek advice from vet. Avoid bandaging wounds unless otherwise instructed by a vet, as improper bandaging can lead to complications if wrapped too tightly.


Paw and nail injuries
It's a good idea to regularly check between your dog’s paw pads for any stuck objects that might irritate or cause infection or pain. This is especially important in the summer months when grass seeds can become stuck in between the toes and migrate through the body.  Occasionally, your dog may cut their pad by walking on a sharp object. If this happens, keep the cut clean and dry and see the vet as soon as possible if a flap is evident or the pad is bleeding.

Your dog may catch or tear their claws when running or playing, causing the nails to break or split. This can make the area tender as the tissue underneath is very sensitive. Your vet can advise if the nail needs cutting back, removing altogether, or bandaging while it heals.

During colder months, your dog’s paws can get irritated or grazed. Keep the fur around their pads well-trimmed, and after each winter walk, clean your dog's paws. Also, keep an eye out for cracked and dry paws, which can cause discomfort and pain.


Burns
If your dog gets burnt, immediately apply cool water to the affected area. Keep running or flushing cool water over the burn for as long as possible (five minutes as a minimum but preferably longer) before taking to a vet. If the burn is very bad, call the vet for advice while you are cooling the burn.

Dogs are also susceptible to sunburn, particularly on areas of their skin with less fur. This can include the nose, ears, and areas on their tummy. It’s best to limit the time your dog spends in the sun and make sure they always have access to shady areas and water if they’re outside.


Sprains, breaks and bruises
Limping or refusing to put weight on a limb are common signs of an injury like a sprain, strain, or break. If you suspect your dog has a sprain, strain, or break, try to keep your dog from moving until you have spoken to your vet, who can advise you what to do next.

If you must move your dog, support the affected area gently, avoiding force or bending and be aware that they may react to the pain negatively. If your dog is struggling to stand, then a towel used as a sling under their body can be useful for moving them safely.


Choking
Due to their size, tennis balls are one of the biggest choking hazards to dogs as they can get stuck in their mouths and block the airway. Sticks or bones are another common danger as they can break and get lodged across the roof of the mouth.

If your dog is choking, acting quickly but calmly is essential. Call anyone close by for assistance, and if you can see the object blocking their airway, carefully try to remove it from the side to avoid pushing it further down, being cautious to avoid getting bitten.

The best option is to get your dog to the vet as quickly as possible and alert them in advance so they can be prepared. Time is of the essence when it comes to choking, so swift action in getting professional help is essential.


Seizures
If your dog experiences a seizure, create a calm environment by reducing lights, sounds, and anything that may stimulate them. Do not attempt to touch or reassure your dog with words during the seizure. If possible, time how long the seizure lasts - most seizures will last less than two minutes. Contact your vet immediately, who will provide you with further instructions over the phone.

Don't put your hands in your dog's mouth during a seizure to try and move the tongue. Your dog won't choke on their tongue, but you could get badly bitten.

After a seizure, your dog will be confused and disorientated. Don't pet your dog at this time, as even the calmest dogs may be confused or scared, which could cause them to bite. Give them space and leave them to come around from the seizure in their own time, monitoring from a safe distance. Please be aware that it's not unusual for dogs to empty their bladder and bowel during a seizure.


Dog bites
Dog bites resulting from a dog fight or attack are very distressing for you and your dog. As hard as it is, try to stay composed and never attempt to physically separate two dogs fighting. Once the incident is over, check for wounds. These can be challenging to spot beneath their coat, but there may also be bruising, making any puncture marks easier to see.

Carefully clean any wounds with cotton wool wetted with sterile salt-water and contact your vet to find out if a visit is required.


Heatstroke and hypothermia
Hot and cold weather can pose a risk to your dog, so it's essential to be aware of the signs of heatstroke and hypothermia. Always contact your vet immediately if you suspect your dog has hypothermia or heatstroke, as both are serious conditions, and early treatment is crucial.

Steps to take in an emergency
In a medical emergency, promptly taking the following steps can significantly improve your dog's chances of a full and speedy recovery:

Stay calm: In any emergency, it's crucial to stay as calm as possible. Staying composed will help you think clearly, act effectively, and reassure your dog. 
Call for help: If possible, call for help immediately. Contact your vet to inform them of the situation and that you're on your way. If needed, have someone else call for help while you focus on your dog.
Provide basic first aid: Carefully administer first aid as needed. This may include reassuring your dog, applying pressure to wounds, or dealing with choking hazards.
Handle your dog with care: Be gentle and cautious while handling your dog, especially if they’re in pain. Avoid sudden movements that might hurt or make them uncomfortable.
Transport safely: If your dog needs immediate medical attention, transport them carefully. If possible, have someone else drive while you keep your dog stable and comfortable.
Follow-up with the vet: After receiving emergency care, always follow up with your vet. They can thoroughly check your dog and recommend further treatment or monitoring.
