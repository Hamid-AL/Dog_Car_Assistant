Just like you, your dog needs exercise to stay fit and healthy. A good exercise routine for your dog can ward off obesity, slow cognitive decline, promote healthy joints and muscles, improve cardiovascular health, and provide fantastic bonding time! While you're developing an exercise routine for your pup (and possibly yourself), you’ll want to keep in mind how much exercise a dog needs.

Find out how much your dog should exercise and how to determine if your pet’s current workout routine is up to snuff.

Factors That Determine a Dog's Exercise Requirements
While we can (and will) provide general guidelines for a dog’s exercise requirements, it’s important to remember that each dog is an individual. Your dog’s need for physical activity is affected by their breed, age, health conditions, and individual personality. 

Breed
Your dog’s breed can impact how active they need to be. For example, while a pug or mastiff might enjoy lounging around the house for hours on end, more active breeds like Siberian huskies or Jack Russell terriers might begin to display behavioral issues when they’re not receiving adequate exercise. 

Breed-specific characteristics can also impact how intense exercise can be. A flat-faced (brachycephalic) dog like the aforementioned pug may struggle to breathe and experience heat exhaustion if pushed too hard during exercise. Dogs with longer snouts like huskies will generally have an easier time breathing during high-intensity workout time.

The pug might be content with one 20-to-30-minute stroll while the husky might need three half-hour speed-walks around the neighborhood to burn off their energy.

Age
Your dog’s age also impacts their exercise requirements. Puppies are more likely to enjoy short bursts of activity. Some veterinarians recommend that pet parents provide five minutes of exercise for each month of age once or twice a day for puppies. So, by the time they’re six months old, their activity sessions may last around 30 minutes.

Warning
Intense exercise can cause damage to a young dog’s growth plates. Growing dogs should not partake in high-intensity workouts like running, jogging, or hiking until they reach the following approximate ages:



Small breed: 6 to 8 months
Medium breed: 12 months
Large or giant breed: 12 to 24 months



You should speak with your veterinarian to determine when your dog’s exercise restrictions are lifted.



On the other end of the spectrum, don't forget about senior dogs! It’s a mistake to stop exercising your dog because they’re older. You simply need to consider if your dog is experiencing any health issues like arthritis and adjust accordingly. Senior dogs often do better with low-intensity workouts like a gentle walk.

Health Status
Some health conditions may decrease your dog’s exercise intolerance. Examples of health issues that may impact your dog’s exercise needs include:

Arthritis
Respiratory disease
Heart disease
Obesity
Endocrine disorders like hypothyroidism or Cushing’s disease
If your dog has a chronic health condition, it's always a good idea to get your dog's exercise plans cleared by your veterinarian.

Personality
Remember, dogs are individuals! Labrador retrievers may be couch potatoes or dock-divers. You’ll need to consider your pet’s need for interaction, mental stimulation, and movement when figuring out how much exercise they need.

General Exercise Guidelines for Dogs
The following are general guidelines for exercising any dog:

Your dog should exercise every day.
Short daily exercise is better than a long exercise once weekly.
Aim for at least one 20-to-30-minute leisurely walk for a low-energy adult dog. Aim for at least two 30-minute brisk walks for a high-energy adult dog.
Check with your veterinarian for specific exercise recommendations and restrictions for your growing puppy.
Pay attention to the weather. Some dogs are more sensitive to temperature extremes, and hot or frozen surfaces can be dangerous for your dog’s paws.
Bring water on hot and/or humid days.
Walking and running aren’t the only ways to get your dog physical activity. Below is an additional list of exercises suitable for dogs:

Hiking
Playing fetch, tug-of-war, hide-and-seek, or other games
Swimming (in safe locations)
Advanced training classes such as agility training
Running through a homemade obstacle course in the yard
Dock diving
Playing with other friendly dogs
Signs Your Dog Isn’t Getting Enough Exercise
If you’re not sure if your dog is getting enough exercise, look to your dog’s behavior and health for answers.

Behavioral Issues
Dogs who aren’t getting enough exercise are more likely to develop behavioral issues, especially anxiety. Anxiety in dogs can manifest as whining, barking, pacing, destructiveness, house-soiling, and self-injury. Chewing on items they shouldn’t, repeatedly bringing toys to you, and repeatedly asking to go outside are all signs that your dog may need more exercise (and attention!).

Health Problems
Dogs who don’t get enough exercise are prone to certain health conditions like obesity and arthritis. However, if you notice that your dog is developing health problems, you should always get them evaluated by a veterinarian before assuming they just need more exercise.

Signs Your Dog Is Getting Too Much Exercise
Signs that your dog is getting too much exercise include:

Trying to stop and lie down while exercising
Heavy panting
Excessive drooling
Reddened gums and/or tongue
Stiffness and limping after exercising
Make sure you are familiar with the signs of heat exhaustion so that you can intervene if your pet is overheating.

The Finish Line
Your dog needs and deserves daily exercise, but you’ll need to tailor their exercise routine to meet their individual needs. If you have any concerns about your dog’s exercise requirements, it’s best to speak with your veterinarian.




How to Keep Your Cool If, or When, Your New Dog Destroys Your House
Learn how to stay calm and guide your destructive pup toward better behavior.

By Katie Koschalk Published on 10/01/24

Bringing a new dog home is exciting, but it’s not always the picture-perfect experience you envisioned. One day you’re gushing over how adorable they are, and the next, you’re surveying the damage after they’ve chewed through your couch or ripped apart your favorite shoes. It can be tough to not let your frustration take over in these moments, but staying calm is crucial for your pup’s well-being.

We talked with professional dog trainers for tips on how to keep your cool and effectively guide your pup toward better behavior when they inevitably destroy something in your home.

Why Do Dogs Destroy Things?
Dogs destroy things in our homes for various reasons, and it’s not always easy to pinpoint exactly why they used your coffee table’s leg as a chew toy. However, trying to understand the root cause can help you address the behavior more effectively. Here are some common reasons:

Boredom: One of the most frequent causes of destructive behavior is boredom. When dogs don’t get enough mental or physical stimulation, they often turn to destructive activities to entertain themselves. A lack of toys, attention, or exercise can all contribute to this behavior.
Separation anxiety: Many dogs experience anxiety when left alone for long periods, which can manifest in destructive behavior. Chewing or tearing things apart may be their way of coping with the stress and trying to self-soothe in your absence.
Teething: For puppies, teething is a natural but uncomfortable process, and chewing helps to alleviate the discomfort. During this phase, puppies are more prone to destroy things, as their mouths explore the world around them.
Instinctual behavior: Some dogs are simply following their instincts. Breeds with a strong prey drive, such as Jack Russell terriers, Yorkshire terriers, and dachshunds, might have a natural urge to tear things apart, as they would with prey in the wild.
Seeking attention: Sometimes, dogs destroy things to get your attention. If they notice that chewing on your belongings results in you engaging with them, they may continue the behavior as a way to interact with you.
Stress or frustration: Changes in routine, new environments, or even frustration with lack of access to certain areas can trigger destructive behaviors. Dogs may chew or destroy objects as a way to express their stress or frustration.
How to React When Your Dog Destroys Something
“Although for most of us the first impulse is to get upset with the dog, punishment or scolding isn’t the best response from a training standpoint,” says Rhiannon van Lidth de Jeude Roemer, KPA-CTP, dog trainer and events coordinator at Raintown Dog Training.

Here's what to do instead.

Redirect their attention: If you catch your dog in the act, van Lidth de Jeude Roemer recommends staying calm and redirecting their focus to something appropriate, like a chew toy or a designated digging spot. This teaches them what behaviors are acceptable.
Move them to another room before cleanup: Elisha Stynchula, CPDT-KA, CNWI, CTDI, FDM, dog trainer and owner of “I Said Sit!” School for Dogs, advises against letting your dog watch as you clean up a destroyed item. If they see you handling it, they might assume you’re playing with it, reinforcing the idea that chewing it is acceptable. To avoid this confusion, place your dog in another room while you clean up.
Resist the urge to scold: According to van Lidth de Jeude Roemer, a harsh word might stop your pup from chewing the sofa or scratching the door if caught in the moment, but it’s unlikely to prevent the behavior in other situations, like when you're not around. Plus, it may make your dog anxious or fearful of you.
How to Train Your Dog Not To Destroy Things
Training your dog not to chew on inappropriate items can feel like an uphill battle, but with consistency, patience, and the right approach, you can help your dog learn what’s off-limits and what’s fair game. Here’s what to do:

Provide plenty of interactive options: “First, you need to ensure your dog has plenty of ‘legal’ outlets for their natural behaviors, including high-value chew items, opportunities to dig, and mentally stimulating activities,” van Lidth de Jeude Roemer says. Teach them what they can play with and rotate their toys and activities regularly to keep them interested, she adds.
Use positive reinforcement: When your dog chews on an appropriate item, reward them with praise, treats, or playtime. This helps reinforce the idea that chewing on their toys is a good thing.
Supervise and manage: While your dog is still learning what’s off-limits, management is key. “Either keep the dog in a puppy-proofed pen/room/crate or block off their access to problem areas,” van Lidth de Jeude Roemer says. “We want to prevent the dog from rehearsing these unwanted behaviors.”
Provide adequate exercise: A tired dog is a well-behaved dog (well, sometimes). Make sure your dog is getting enough exercise in the form of walks or playtime, Stynchula says. Puzzle toys, snuffle mats, and games like fetch or tug-of-war can also help burn off excess energy.
Teach the “leave it” command: The “leave it” command is a valuable tool for preventing unwanted chewing. Practice this command with treats and toys, rewarding your dog when they respond correctly. Over time, this command can help you stop them from chewing inappropriate objects before it starts.
Don’t give mixed signals: It’s important to be consistent with what your dog is allowed to chew. Avoid giving them old shoes, socks, or other household items to chew on, as this can confuse them. Your dog won’t know the difference between an old shoe and your new pair if they’ve been allowed to chew on similar items in the past.
By staying calm, understanding your dog’s needs, and focusing on consistent training, you can help guide your new pup toward better behavior and a happier home.


Puppy Blues Are Real—Here's How to Deal With Them
Feeling sad or anxious after bringing home a new puppy is normal and common.

By Katie Koschalk Published on 10/01/24

You’ve been dreaming of getting a puppy for years, and now you’ve finally welcomed a little furball into your home. You expected to feel a bit tired from your pup’s playful antics, but you didn’t see the puppy blues coming—feeling sad, anxious, or completely overwhelmed after bringing your new puppy home. What gives?

If you're feeling this way, rest assured—you’re not alone, and it doesn't make you a bad pet parent. Many new puppy parents experience these emotions as they adjust to the significant life changes that come with a new puppy.

We spoke with pet parents who have conquered the puppy blues and also got advice from a professional dog trainer on overcoming this early challenge.

What Are the Puppy Blues?
Puppy blues refer to intense feelings of anxiety and sadness that some pet parents experience after bringing home a new puppy. You might feel drained, causing yourself to question whether you’re cut out for being a dog parent. These emotions generally stem from any combination of the following:

The sudden responsibility of caring for a puppy
Disruptions to your routine and social life
Lack of sleep that often comes with early puppyhood
Impacts on your home (such as chewed furniture or accidents)
Lack of preparedness
Prolonged training, i.e. taking longer or is more difficult than anticipated 
A misunderstanding of what it takes to raise a puppy
This emotional dip often comes after the initial excitement wears off, and reality sets in, as happened with Emily Jenkins, the dog parent of Chai. “When I picked Chai up, I felt so happy and excited, but over the next week, I started to feel more and more anxious and sad,” Jenkins says. “All I could see were all the problems she was causing me.”

While some new pet parents might be gleeful from the get-go, the puppy blues are a common and normal response to a big life change. They don’t mean you’re failing as a pet parent and, rest assured, you can still go on to build an incredible relationship with your dog.

How Long Do the Puppy Blues Last?
The puppy blues timeline is different for everyone, explains Alexandra Bassett, CPDT-KA, owner of Dog Savvy, and can be affected by various factors such as your puppy’s temperament, how much support you have, your schedule, and whether or not your puppy has pronounced behavioral issues, such as separation anxiety and excessive barking.

During the first few weeks, the exhaustion from sleepless nights, constant monitoring, training frustrations, and the pressure to get everything right can make it feel like the blues will never end. However, as your puppy grows, learns, mellows out, and starts responding to training, life usually gets much easier.

For Lenox Soto, the dog parent of Spotty, the puppy blues were brief.

“The first few weeks, I felt overwhelmed and anxious due to the added work and having to be constantly on guard to keep him out of trouble,” he says. “There were a few days I questioned my decision, but I found my new groove pretty quickly, and now he’s my best bud.”

For Jenkins, things took a bit longer to balance out. “I got Chai when she was two months old, and it took me until she was seven months old to start liking her and not regretting my decision,” she says. “Once she became a bit more mature and settled, I became less anxious and was able to enjoy her company more."

Tips for Coping With the Puppy Blues
If you’re going through the puppy blues, the good news is that there are steps you can take to improve your situation and, consequently, your feelings of anxiety and sadness. Here are some tips to help you navigate this challenge:  

Start Training Right Away
It's tempting to wait and let your puppy settle in before starting training, but getting started early can make a big difference. Puppies are like sponges, and the sooner you introduce basic commands and boundaries, the quicker they’ll learn.

Beginning training right away sets the stage for good behavior and helps prevent bad habits from taking root. Whether you're working on crate training, potty training, teaching them not to jump on (or chew) furniture, or simple commands like “sit” and “stay,” establishing expectations right away helps your puppy understand what’s allowed, making life easier for both of you. Plus, training is a great opportunity to bond with your new pup!

And if you don't want to tackle training alone, puppy classes are a great alternative.

“Puppy classes were a game-changer for both Chai and me,” Jenkins shares. “Chai picked up important skills, and I always left the classes feeling so much more confident and in control as a pet parent."

Stick to a Routine
“Creating good habits starts with setting up a routine so the puppy knows what to expect each day,” Bassett says. This can help you feel more in control and encourage your puppy to adjust to the rhythm of your daily life.

Teaching your puppy when it’s time to eat, sleep, play, and go potty creates consistency and helps reduce confusion and misbehavior.

Use Behavior Management Tools
“Behavior management tools like crates, playpens, and gates are essential to your success,” Bassett says. These tools help prevent bad habits, such as pottying wherever they please, and keep your puppy safe from harm when unsupervised.

And for Soto, these tools were key.

“Using a crate and gates made such a difference,” he explains. “I could finally step away for a bit without worrying that he was getting into trouble, which helped me feel more relaxed during those early weeks.”

Puppy-Proof Your Home
Puppies are naturally curious and tend to get into things they shouldn’t, which can lead to accidents or destructive behavior. Take the time to remove or secure hazards, like electrical cords, household cleaners, and small objects that can be chewed or swallowed. This proactive step helps keep your puppy safe and saves you the stress of constantly worrying about what they might get into.

Lean On Fellow Pet Parents
Talking to others who have gone through the same experience can be incredibly reassuring. Reach out to friends, join online puppy parent groups, or connect with a community where you can share your struggles and get advice.

If possible, you can also have a friend or family member step in for an hour or two so you can have some time to yourself.

Focus on Small Wins
Puppyhood can be frustrating, but celebrating the small victories—like going potty in an appropriate place or sleeping through the night—can help you stay positive. These wins are signs that things are getting better, even if progress feels slow.

It’s easy to get caught up in the day-to-day struggles of puppyhood, but it’s important to keep the bigger picture in mind.

“Remind yourself that the initial challenges you’re facing are just a small part of the journey,” Soto says. “The hard work you put in now sets the foundation for years of companionship with a well-behaved, awesome dog that will add so much to your life.”

Remember to Care for Yourself
Don’t forget to take care of yourself, too, whether it’s getting enough sleep, making healthy meals, exercising, or doing something you enjoy.

“It wasn’t until I started prioritizing my own needs and letting go of perfectionism that things truly took a lasting turn for the better,” Jenkins says. “I realized that if I wasn’t taking care of myself, I couldn’t properly take care of her.”

It’s also important to give yourself grace during this period. Raising a puppy is a big responsibility, and it’s normal to have ups and downs. Be kind to yourself, and remember that it’s normal and okay to have challenging moments and days. These difficult times will pass, and soon, you’ll start to enjoy all the wonderful aspects of having a furry best friend by your side.

Dogs earned their “man’s best friend” nickname for a reason. These loyal companions are up for practically any adventure and will gladly follow their humans wherever they lead. They’re with us through thick and thin—the highs, the lows, and the seemingly boring moments of everyday life. Many dogs bond with their owners right away. But, for others, learning to trust can take a little more time and patience.

Here are five ways to bond with your dog and foster a strong, meaningful connection.

The Importance of Bonding With Your Dog
Dogs have evolved alongside humans for millennia. These domesticated animals not only adore spending time with us, but they also rely on us for survival. Bonding with your dog is a key responsibility of being a pet owner—not to mention the fact that having a supportive, affectionate four-legged best friend living in your home can be amazing for your mental health.

“A deep bond results in a happier dog,” Em Muench, professional dog trainer and founder of Barkology Dog Training in Des Moines, Iowa, says. “Dogs are social animals that thrive on interaction and companionship. When they feel connected to their owner, they are less likely to experience stress, anxiety, or behavioral problems. This leads to a more fulfilling life for both the dog and the owner.”

Create A Routine

Dogs—like humans—are creatures of habit. Sticking to a predictable schedule can help put them at ease, especially if they’re new to your home. Routines can also help with training, like teaching your pup to go potty outside. Feeding, walking, and playing with your dog at roughly the same time every day is a great place to start.

Meet Their Physical and Mental Needs

Dogs can’t take themselves for walks or open up the pantry (thank goodness). This means that, as pet parents, it’s vitally important to meet their physical and mental needs. These vary based on their age, breed, health, and other factors. But, at a bare minimum, pet parents must always provide access to fresh water, serve nutritious dog food, offer regular opportunities to exercise, and promote mental enrichment using puzzle toys, training, and interactive play.

Understand Their Cues

Dogs can’t talk, but that doesn’t mean they don’t communicate. As a pet parent, you can glean a wealth of information about your dog’s current state of mind or needs by learning to interpret their body language and behaviors, Muench says. Once you learn how to read these signals, you can respond appropriately.

“One of my favorite training quotes is, ‘Your dog isn't giving you a hard time—they're having a hard time,’" Muench says. “This serves as a reminder that we sometimes overlook how our dogs are experiencing the world around them. By understanding their signals and knowing how to read their body language, it can give us a deeper understanding of how they feel, enabling us to help them navigate and cope with the human-centered world they live in.”

When dogs are excited, of course, they show you by wagging their tails. But the “I’m so stoked you’re home!” wag is much different from the loose, relaxed way your pup wags their tail when she’s contentedly walking through the park. And when dogs are uncomfortable, for instance, they often exhibit appeasement behaviors—like yawning, licking their lips, or avoiding eye contact.

Advocate for Your Dog and Their Needs

Dogs, like humans, are individuals who have their own likes, dislikes, habits, and quirks. Some dogs love going to the dog park to romp with other pups, while others prefer a more solitary lifestyle. Some pooches love to be hugged and squeezed, while others would rather sit as far away from you on the opposite side of the couch. Some pups will calmly interact with little kids, while others prefer the company of older teens and adults.

Take the time to really get to know your dog. That way, you can more confidently avoid putting them in situations that might cause fear, anxiety, or discomfort. And don’t be afraid to speak up on their behalf. For example, if your dog doesn’t like meeting new people, kindly but firmly ask strangers not to approach them while you’re out in public, Muench says.

“When a dog knows that they can rely on their parent to advocate for them based on what they're telling them, it builds trust between them—creating a happier and more comfortable dog,” Muench says.

Use Reward-Based Training

One of the best ways to build and establish trust is by communicating clearly—and, for dogs, this is most easily achieved through reward-based training. Your dog doesn’t intuitively know how you want them to behave. But when you reward them for specific behaviors—with a treat, praise, or a toy—you’re communicating that he’s doing the right thing. Over time, this positive reinforcement helps your dog understand your expectations—and that’s a win-win for both of you.

Strong Bonds Mean Confident, Well-Behaved Pets
In the end, bonding with your dog boils down to some fairly simple steps rooted in compassion, empathy, and understanding. Whether you just adopted a puppy or rescued a senior dog, consider implementing some of these tips at home to create a strong bond with your pet.

“The more safe and secure your dog can feel with you, the more confident and well-behaved they will be,” Muench says.

How to Change Behaviors
 Back to Top
Desensitization and counterconditioning are two training methods that may help your dog overcome reactivity and negative feelings toward certain people, animals, or other triggers. If your dog is exhibiting fear or anxiety, it is important to develop a plan that is consistent1 and based on proven methods2 to retrain your dog's thought processes and reactions.

What Is Desensitization?
One of the most commonly recommended ways to help your dog overcome their fears is to utilize a training technique called desensitization. Desensitization is a behavioral modification process that exposes your dog to their fears in a very slow, low-level way that increases over time in order to teach them not to react negatively.

Desensitization helps your dog learn that the thing they're afraid of has no reason to be feared. If your dog was once sensitive to an object, noise, or person, desensitization training will make that stimulus seem unimportant or just like any other thing your dog isn't afraid of. Desensitization training is often used in conjunction with counterconditioning training.

What Is Counterconditioning?
Counterconditioning is a training technique that is often used alongside desensitization training. If your dog reacts in a negative way to a stimulus, counterconditioning may reverse your dog's reaction from something unwanted to something that is wanted, or from a negative reaction to a positive one.

For example, imagine if every time your dog saw a person walk by the house, they lunged at the window, growled, barked, and scratched up your windowsill. These negative feelings and unwanted behaviors need to be turned into positive feelings and wanted behaviors. Counterconditioning training can make this reversal happen by helping your dog associate the person walking by with a positive or happy experience. Treats, attention, verbal praise, special toys, and other forms of positive reinforcement are used as rewards in this type of behavior modification.

How to Use Desensitization and Counterconditioning to Change Your Dog's Behavior
Depending on the specific behavior, situation, and pet, it may take longer for some dogs to unlearn what they've been conditioned into but if you are consistent and patient, you can make positive changes.

Determine Your Dog's Triggers
Is it a sound, smell, person, or object? This may take some observational skills on your part but once you determine what it is, you can begin the training by introducing your dog to their trigger in a way that won't cause them to be scared, aggressive, fearful, etc.

It is critical to understand the subtle signs of fear and anxiety in dogs to be able to identify the true trigger. Sometimes the dog will show subtle signs that then escalate and appear to be in reaction to something that is actually not the trigger. For example, if a dog is nervous about the mail man but then seems to bark and become aggressive toward a housemate or person in the house. We need to identify the very first symptoms of fear and anxiety and retrain to that trigger.

Practice Positive Reinforcement Around the Trigger
If an object is the trigger for your dog's negative thoughts and behavior, you'll want to place that item far away from your dog at first. Make sure your dog can see the item but that he doesn't react negatively to it. Every time your dog notices their trigger and doesn't react in a negative way, reward. This reward may be your dog's favorite toy, verbal praise and petting, or an extra-special treat.

Keep the item in this place for a period of time, usually a few days, or expose it to your dog each day for a few hours if you are unable to place it somewhere semi-permanently. Over time, slowly move the item closer and closer to your dog while constantly rewarding your dog when they see the item without reacting in an unwanted manner. If your dog begins to react negatively as you move the item closer, you can move it back a bit to slow the process down.

Don't Scold Your Dog
Do not scold your dog if they react in an unwanted manner, but instead reward your dog when they don't react so they can begin to associate the trigger with a positive outcome. Over time, your dog may even begin to ignore the object. Eventually the item will be close to your dog, but they will have realized that there is nothing to be afraid of, or desensitized. The dog will also associate the item with something positive like treats, toys, praise, and petting due to the counterconditioning training that was done concurrently.

Start Small
The combination of these two training techniques can be utilized in similar ways for smells, sounds, and even people that cause your dog to react in an unwanted way. Start with a faint smell or quiet sound and work your way up to a stronger smell or louder sound if those things are the triggers. If the trigger is a person, start with the person being far away and over time have them move closer, just like you would with an object.

Be Patient
Despite the type of trigger, it's important to remember that these training sessions are on your dog's timeline, not yours. Discuss your training plans with your veterinarian. They may have some supplement recommendations that can help decrease anxiety and improve learning progress. If a pet is nervous about something, helping to decrease these feelings should speed the training process and improve outcomes.

If you try and rush things, desensitization and counterconditioning will not work. You do not want to overstimulate, scare, or force your dog into anything, as it could make things worse. You instead want your dog to slowly become comfortable and associate the trigger with something positive. This can only be done by being patient and observant of your dog's reactions.



10 Common Dog Behavior Problems and Solutions
Causes and Solutions When Your Pet Misbehaves

Dog behavior problems are often misunderstood or mishandled by dog owners. Perhaps you are new to dog ownership, considering getting a dog, or just wishing to help your dog with a challenging issue.

Thoroughly understanding the most common dog behavior problems is the first step to solving and preventing them. A solid foundation of obedience training will help you avoid or better control many of these issues.

The Beginner's Guide to Dog Care

Barking

Most dogs vocalize in one way or another. They may bark, howl, whine, and more. Excessive barking is considered a behavior problem.

Before you can correct excessive barking, determine why your dog is vocalizing in the first place. The most common types of barking are:

Warning or alert
Playfulness and excitement
Attention-seeking
Anxiety
Boredom
Responding to other dogs
Learn to control excessive barking. Consider teaching them bark/quiet commands. Be consistent and patient. Address any underlying causes of barking. Dedication and attention to detail can go a long way to stop a dog from barking.

Chewing

Chewing is a natural action for all dogs. In fact, chewing is an important activity for most dogs; it's just part of the way they are wired. However, excessive chewing can quickly become a behavior problem if your dog causes destruction. The most common reasons dogs chew include:1

Puppy teething
Boredom or excess energy
Anxiety
Curiosity (especially puppies)
Encourage your dog to chew on the right things by providing plenty of appropriate chew toys. Keep personal items away from your dog. When you are not home, keep your dog crated or confined to an area where less destruction can be caused.

If you catch your dog chewing the wrong thing, get your dog's attention and replace the item with a chew toy. One of the most important things you can do is to make sure your dog gets plenty of exercise to burn off energy and be stimulated in that way rather than turning to chewing.

03

Digging

If given the chance, most dogs will do some amount of digging; it's a matter of instinct. Certain dog breeds, like terriers, are more prone to digging because of their hunting histories. In general, most dogs dig for these reasons:

Boredom or excess energy
Anxiety or fear
Hunting instinct
Comfort-seeking (such as nesting or cooling off)
Desire to hide possessions (like bones or toys)
To escape or gain access to an area
It can be frustrating if your dog digs up your yard. Try and determine the cause of the digging, then work to eliminate that source. Give your dog more exercise, spend more quality time together, and work on extra training. If digging seems inevitable, set aside an area where your dog can freely dig, like a sandbox. Train your dog that it is acceptable to dig in this area only.

Separation anxiety is one of the most commonly discussed dog behavior problems. Manifestations include vocalization, chewing, inappropriate urination and defecation, and other forms of destruction that occur when a dog is separated from his owner.2 Not all of these actions are the result of separation anxiety. Signs of true separation anxiety include:

The dog becomes anxious when the owner prepares to leave.
Misbehavior occurs in the first 15 to 45 minutes after the owner leaves.
The dog wants to follow the owner around constantly.
The dog tries to touch the owner whenever possible.
True separation anxiety requires dedicated training, behavior modification, and desensitization exercises. Medication may be recommended in extreme cases.

Inappropriate Elimination

Inappropriate urination and defecation are among the most frustrating dog behaviors. They can damage areas of your home and make your dog unwelcome in public places or at the homes of others. It is most important that you discuss this behavior with your veterinarian first to rule out health problems. If no medical cause is found, try to determine the reason for the behavior, which can come down to one of the following:

Submissive/excited urination
Territorial marking
Anxiety
Lack of proper housetraining
Inappropriate elimination is unavoidable in puppies, especially before 12 weeks of age. Older dogs are another story. Many dogs require serious behavior modification to rid them of the habit once it becomes ingrained. Eventually, most grown (potty-trained) dogs can learn to ring so-called “doggy doorbells” to let their owners know when to let them out for a bathroom break.

Begging

Begging is a bad habit, but many dog owners inadvertently encourage it. This can lead to digestive problems and obesity.3 Dogs beg because they love food. However, table scraps are not treats, and food is not love. Yes, it is hard to resist that longing look, but giving in "just this once" creates a problem in the long run.

Before you sit down to eat, tell your dog to go to their place, preferably where they won't be able to stare at you. If necessary, confine your dog to another room. If they behave, offer a special treat after you and your family are finished eating.

Chasing

A dog's desire to chase moving things is simply a display of predatory instinct. Many dogs will chase other animals, people, and cars. All of these can lead to dangerous and devastating outcomes. While you may not be able to stop your dog from trying to chase, you can take steps to prevent disaster.

Keep your dog confined or on a leash at all times (unless directly supervised indoors).
Train your dog to come when called.
Have a dog whistle or noisemaker on hand to get your dog's attention.
Stay aware and watch for potential triggers, such as cars, joggers, and wildlife.
Your best chance at success is to keep the chase from getting out of control. Dedicated training throughout your dog's life will teach them to focus their attention on you first, before running off.

Jumping Up

Jumping up is a common and natural behavior in dogs. Puppies jump up to reach and greet their mothers. Later, they may jump up when greeting people. Dogs may also jump up when excited or seeking an item in the person's hands. A jumping dog can be annoying and even dangerous.

There are many methods to stop a dog's jumping, but not all will be successful. Lifting a knee, grabbing the paws, or pushing the dog away might work in some cases, but for most dogs, this sends the wrong message. Jumping up is often attention-seeking behavior, so any acknowledgment of your dog's actions provides an instant reward, which reinforces the jumping.

The best method is to simply ignore your dog. Walk away if necessary. Do not make eye contact, speak, or touch your dog. Go about your business. When he relaxes and remains still, calmly reward him. It won't take long before your dog gets the message.

Biting

Dogs bite and nip for several reasons, most of which are instinctive. Puppies bite and nip to explore the environment. Mother dogs teach their puppies not to bite too hard and discipline them when needed. This helps the puppies develop bite inhibition. Owners often need to show their puppies that mouthing and biting are not acceptable by continuing to teach bite inhibition.

Beyond puppy behavior, dogs may bite for several reasons. The motivation to bite or snap is not necessarily about aggression. A dog may snap, nip, or bite for a variety of reasons.

Fear
Defensiveness
Protection of property
Pain or sickness
Predatory instinct
Any dog may bite if the circumstances warrant it in the dog's mind. Owners and breeders are the ones who can help decrease the tendency for any type of dog to bite through proper training, socialization, and breeding practices.

Aggression

Dog aggression is exhibited by growling, snarling, showing teeth, lunging, and biting. It is important to know that any dog has the potential to show aggression, regardless of breed or history. However, dogs with violent or abusive histories and those bred from dogs with aggressive tendencies are more likely to exhibit aggressive behavior toward people or other dogs.

Unfortunately, some breeds are labeled "dangerous" and banned in certain areas. However, it's not usually about the breed so much as it's about history. A dog's environment has a major impact on behavior. Also, regardless of breed, a dog may inherit some aggressive traits.4

Reasons for aggression are the same as the reasons a dog will bite or snap, but overall canine aggression is a much more serious problem. If your dog has aggressive tendencies, consult your vet first as it may stem from a health problem. Then, seek the help of an experienced dog trainer or behaviorist. Serious measures should be taken to keep others safe from aggressive dogs.

How to Choose the Right Dog for You
If you suspect your pet is sick, call your vet immediately. For health-related questions, always consult your veterinarian, as they have examined your pet, know the pet's health history, and can make the best recommendations for your pet.

Let's face it: Our dogs are spoiled every single day, but their birthdays are a legitimate reason for some serious doggy spoilage! Whether your pooch prefers tennis balls, Kongs, or softer, homemade toys, there's no better reason than its birthday to hit up the toy aisle at your pet store.

Dog party decorations

You've helped your friends and family decorate for a million birthday parties, so it's only appropriate that you decorate for your precious pooch's birthday.

Balloons and streamers are standard birthday party decor, of course, but there are tons of doggy-themed ways to do it up, too. Make a cute, bone-shaped banner with construction paper and yarn or twine, toss dog-friendly confetti on all of the tables, and—if you're a little bit craftier—make a chalkboard sign with the drink and snack menu.

If you're not super crafty, you can buy doggy-themed banners online instead.

Believe it or not, lots of dog-friendly birthday cakes are human-friendly, too. All you need are some everyday baking ingredients, such as whole-wheat flour, baking soda, eggs, and applesauce or baby food, to make an amazing canine cake. Blend in shredded veggies such as carrots for a boost of nutrients and top it with cream cheese, peanut butter, or blended bananas.

Don't feel like breaking out the baking gear? No dog has ever turned down peanut butter paired with his favorite treats.

Although real ice cream isn't great for your dog's gastrointestinal tract, it's easy to whip up some puppy-approved ice cream at home with ingredients you probably already have in your pantry. Blend bananas with plain yogurt and creamy peanut butter, then freeze overnight to get the right consistency. You can also make puppy ice pops with one basic ingredient: Chicken or beef broth. Simply pour it into a mold and freeze.

DIY Some Cute Party Wear

There's literally nothing cuter in the world than a party hat on a puppy. It's super-easy to make your own by gluing—be sure to choose the non-toxic kind—construction paper, poster board, or foam paper into a cone shape. Then, decorate with a permanent marker, pompoms, tassels, or any other accouterments that will make your pupper feel extra festive.

What if your dog won't wear its party hat for longer than 20 seconds? Whip up a no-sew bandana with some cute fabric and fabric glue or hemming tape or a no-sew tutu with elastic and strips of tulle.

Invite the Entire Squad

What's a puppy party without your dog's entire gang? Invite the crew over for a day of running, snacks, and sniffing in celebration of your furry family member's birth.

Put out plenty of water and, if the other pet parents are OK with it, some snacks for paw-ty guests. Portioned dog treats, sliced frozen bananas, baby carrots, and green beans are all healthy snacks that are easy for dogs to pick up and munch on.

Be sure to keep a close eye on your dog and its guests while they're playing. Even the best dog buds can have misunderstandings sometimes.


If you really want to take your puppy party games to the next level, try a round of Snoopy Says. Like the human version, Simon Says, participants listen to commands and make certain movements. The last pupper standing wins!
